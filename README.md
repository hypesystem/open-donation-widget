open-donation-widget
====================

A simple HTML/Javascript widget that allows you to easily show where the money being donated is going.
It leaves styling to the end-user (but there are plans to add some default styles for popular frontend frameworks).
There are also plans to add support for popular backend frameworks, to make it easily integratable.
